You'll need to set your github environmental variables appropriately. Look in `config.ex` if you'd rather just hardcode them in for testing.


To start the application:

  1. Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  2. Install NPM dependencies with `npm install`
  3. Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.create && mix ecto.migrate`
  4. Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phoenix.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

### Votio
This is a simple learning project that I'll be keeping a [(b)log of](http://terakilobyte.com). Each major milestone will live on its' own branch.
